                    Software Development Challenge

Develop a single page application that consumes the chucknorris.io API.
The application should have categories consuming the same API.
 When a category is clicked, load the content coming from the
 PI e.g. category science - All arrays Chuck Norris declares are of infinite size, because Chuck Norris knows no bounds.
There is no required design from us, however build the single page application using react.js and use github pages to host the application. Submit your solution by sending us a link to your github-hosted application.
Note:
Github is free, create an account if you do not already have one.
